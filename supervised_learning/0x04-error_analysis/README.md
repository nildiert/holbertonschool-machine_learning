## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

* What is the confusion matrix?
* What is type I error? type II?
* What is sensitivity? specificity? precision? recall?
* What is an F1 score?
* What is bias? variance?
* What is irreducible error?
* What is Bayes error?
* How can you approximate Bayes error?
* How to calculate bias and variance
* How to create a confusion matrix

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
* Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
