> A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.

## Training


### Gradient descent

Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. In neural networks, it can be used to minimize the error term by changing each weight in proportion to the derivative of the error with respect to that weight, provided the non-linear activation functions are differentiable. Various methods for doing so were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s by Werbos, Williams, Robinson, Schmidhuber, Hochreiter, Pearlmutter and others.

## Global optimization methods

* Each weight encoded in the chromosome is assigned to the respective weight link of the network.
* The training set is presented to the network which propagates the input signals forward.
* The mean-squared-error is returned to the fitness function.
* This function drives the genetic selection process.
